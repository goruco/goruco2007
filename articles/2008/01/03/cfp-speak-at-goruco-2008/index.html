      <h1>CFP: Speak at GoRuCo 2008</h1>
      <p>GoRuCo, a one-day, single-track event in New York City dedicated to everything Ruby, is now accepting proposal papers. This conference will be held on Saturday, April 26th in the Manhattan campus of Pace University, our hosts for the day.</p>


	<p>It will be a technical conference aimed at highly motivated programmers interested in all things Ruby. You&#8217;ll spend the day among Rubyists, Rails developers, and language enthusiasts in New York City, home of Silicon Alley.</p>


	<p>We will select five speakers to give one hour talks, and invite all interested speakers to submit a proposal. Our speakers will receive:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Free attendance to the event</li>
		<li>A $600 honorarium</li>
		<li>A $600 travel reimbursement if you live outside of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut</li>
	</ul>


	<p>We are reserving at least two slots for speakers from New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, so if you live in the tri-state area we strongly urge you to submit a proposal.</p>


	<p>Talks should be about 50 minutes long, including time for questions and discussion. A good proposal paper will include:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>A explanation or outline of your talk.</li>
		<li>A short biographical statement about you and your involvement in the Ruby community.</li>
		<li>Your state of residence.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Your proposal does not need to be long, but it should give us the information necessary to evaluate your talk.</p>


	<p>All proposals must specify exactly who will be presenting. For example, we will not accept proposals from companies unless they specify who will be presenting on behalf of the company. Presentations may be given by more than one person, but multiple speakers will split the honorarium and travel reimbursement.</p>


	<p>Please send all papers to papers@goruco.com by 11:59 <span class="caps">PM EST</span> on January 31st, 2008. You should receive confirmation that we have received your
proposal within 48 hours of submitting it.</p>


	<p>If you have any questions about the proposal process or other conference related questions, please email info@goruco.com. More information on the
conference itself to come. Stay tuned to this website or subscribe to the <a href="http://www.goruco.com/rss/"><span class="caps">RSS</span> feed</a> for updates.</p>
