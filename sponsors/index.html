	<p>Started over a year ago, StreetEasy.com is a small startup that has become one of New York&#8217;s most popular online real estate resources for rentals and sales. With millions of page views a month and thousands of users every day we have changed the way that consumers search for real estate in New York. We are powered by Ruby on Rails (we started with RoR 0.8), growing fast, and we are always looking for good programmers!</p>

	<p>Obtiva is pushing the envelope in the agile and Ruby on Rails communities. Our developers have been actively using Ruby  since 2001 and are leveraging Rails to rapidly deploy maintainable applications for our clients. Out of our project experiences, we have assembled two training classes: &#8220;Ruby on Rails <span class="caps">TDD</span> Boot Camp&#8221; and &#8220;Enterprise Ruby: Bending Rails&#8482;&#8221;.</p>
